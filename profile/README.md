## Hi there 👋

Over here we are developing PromG, a tool enabling you to perform multi-dimensional process analytics by exploiting a multi-layered Event Knowledge Graph.

To learn more about this tool, we have prepared a demo video which you can find [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKXFqHtW3Xw&t=6s). In this demo, we illustrate PromG on the BPIC'17 dataset.

The repository contains the source code (PromG-core) which can be installed as a Python package using `pip install promg' and several example analyses.

🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
